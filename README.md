# Update of values
The home app does not regularly poll for updates of values. Only when switching rooms or close/open the app the actual values are requested.
This behavior is even the case when a AppleTV or HomePod is configured as control center.
There are three possible ways to workaround this.

1. That's ok for your
2. You enable the polling mode
3. You enable the push mode and instrument your PLC code to send the values

## Poll values form PLC
To enable this you have to set `"enablePolling": true;` platform level and on each individual accessory with individual interval in seconds.
    `"enablePolling": true, "pollInterval": 30,`


## Push values from PLC

It possible to send updates of values directly from the plc to the homebridge-plc plugin. This is especially useful when you want notifications form your home app about open/close of doors or just a faster response e.g. with PLC_StatelessProgrammableSwitch.
To enable this you have to set `"enablePolling": true,` platform level and optional the `port`.

The push is done by an http request to the configured port with the keyword `push`. To to have no additional configuration to be synced between PLC and homebrige-plc plugin. The PLC the interface only requires the data base number `db`, the offset within the db `offset`. The value new submitted with `value` is assigned to all matching definitions. In example when using the same PLC destination e.g. for get_SecuritySystemCurrentState and get_SecuritySystemTargetState the value is used for both.
The All information are submitted within the URL.

The Request has to be done as HTTP `PUT` or `GET` operation. There will be no logging when doing a `PUT` operation while there will be detailed output when during a `GET` operation. This in especially intended for testing with the browser as the browser performs a `GET` operation per default.

### Format
Example for float values when trigger from browser

  http://homebridgeIp:8080/?push&db=3&offset=22&value=12.5

Example for bool values when trigger from browser

  http://homebridgeIp:8080/?push&db=5&offset=5.1&value=1

Example for byte values when trigger from browser

  http://homebridgeIp:8080/?push&db=2&offset=3&value=255


# Test & Release

## Local test
The easiest is to open the terminal from homebridge delete the `index.js` file of this plugin, open nano and past in the new content.
Afterwards the Homebridge can be restarted.
The delete and open of hte index.js file can be done by the following command line.

`rm node_modules/homebridge-plc/index.js && nano node_modules/homebridge-plc/index.js`


## Publish npm package

`npm publish --access public`
