- `enablePolling`: (optional) when set to `true` the current state will be polled. It is mandatory as well to enable polling mode on platform level.
- `pollInterval` (optional) poll interval in seconds. Default value is `10` seconds.
- `forceCurrentState`: (optional) when set to `true` the position set by `set_TargetDoorState` is directly used as current state. By this it seems in the home app as the target state was directly reached. This is recommended when not sing `enablePolling` or pushing the value from the plc.
- `get_ObstructionDetected` (optional) offset and bit to obfuscation detection true means that the door was blocked S7 type `Bool` e.g. `55.1` for `DB4DBX55.1`
- `get_CurrentDoorState`: offset to read current state current state S7 type `Byte` e.g. `3` for `DB4DBB3`
	- `0`: open
	- `1`: closed
	- `2`: opening
	- `3`: closing
	- `4`: stopped
- `get_TargetDoorState`: offset to read target state current state S7 type `Byte` e.g. `3` for `DB4DBB3`
	- `0`: open
	- `1`: closed
- `set_TargetDoorState`:  offset to write target state current state S7 type `Byte` e.g. `3` for `DB4DBB3`
	- `0`: open
	- `1`: closed

# Update of values
The home app does not regularly poll for updates of values. Only when switching rooms or close/open the app the actual values are requested.
This behavior is even the case when a AppleTV or HomePod is configured as control center.
There are three possible ways to workaround this.

1. That's ok for you
2. You enable the polling mode
3. You enable the push mode and instrument your PLC code to send the values

## <a name='poll'></a>Poll values form PLC by homebridge-PLC plugin
To enable this you have to set `"enablePolling": true;` platform level and on each individual accessory with individual interval in seconds `"enablePolling": true, "pollInterval": 10,`

Example to poll the contact sensor state every 10 seconds
	{
		"platforms": [
				{
				"platform": "PLC",
				"ip": "10.10.10.32",
				"rack": 0,
				"slot": 2,
				"enablePolling": true,
				"accessories": [
					{
						"accessory": "PLC_ContactSensor",
						"name": "ContactSensor",
						"enablePolling": true,
						"pollInterval": 10,
						"db": 12,
						"get_ContactSensorState": 25.2
					}
				]
			}
		]
	}

## <a name='push'></a>Push values from PLC to homebridge-plc plugin

It possible to send updates of values directly from the plc to the homebridge-plc plugin. This is especially useful when you want notifications form your home app about open/close of doors or just a faster response e.g. with PLC_StatelessProgrammableSwitch.
To enable this you have to set `"enablePush": true,` platform level and optional the `port`.

The push takes place via an http request to the configured port with the keyword "push". In order to avoid that additional configurations to be shared between the PLC and the homebrige-plc-Plugin, the interface is kept very simple.
The interface that the PLC has to use consists only of the keyword 'push', the database number 'db', the address within the db 'offset' and the value 'value'. This allows to on the PLC to create a simple interface to push changed values to the homebridge-plc plugin e.g. I created a FC with just one input of type `ANY` to push all kind of values.

The value is assigned to all matching ('db' and 'offset') get_* accessory configurations. All information is transmitted within the URL and in decimal.

For example the push from the PLC is done as 'http://homebridgeIp:8080/?push&db=1014&offset=1&value=3'
With the following configuration:

	{
		"platforms": [
				{
				"platform": "PLC",
				"ip": "10.10.10.32",
				"rack": 0,
				"slot": 2,
				"enablePush": true,
				"accessories": [
					{
							"accessory": "PLC_SecuritySystem",
							"name": "AlarmSystem",
							"db": 1014,
							"get_SecuritySystemCurrentState": 1,
							"set_SecuritySystemTargetState": 1,
							"get_SecuritySystemTargetState": 1
					}
				]
			}
		]
	}

The value '3' disarmed will be used for both for 'get_SecuritySystemCurrentState' as well as 'get_SecuritySystemTargetState'.

The Request has to be done as HTTP `PUT` or `GET` operation. There will be no logging when doing a `PUT` operation while there will be detailed output when during a `GET` operation. This in especially intended for testing with the browser as the browser performs a `GET` operation per default.

### Format
Example for float values when trigger from browser:

	http://homebridgeIp:8080/?push&db=3&offset=22&value=12.5

Example for bool values when trigger from browser

	http://homebridgeIp:8080/?push&db=5&offset=5.1&value=1

Example for byte values when trigger from browser

	http://homebridgeIp:8080/?push&db=2&offset=3&value=255

**NOTE:** Chrome/Edge does at minimum two requests with different parameters resulting in some error messages. I recommend `Talend API Tester - Free Edition`

# <a name='control'></a>Control of PLC accessories

It´s also possible to control PLC accessories via HTTP `PUT` or `GET` operation. This might be useful for integration into other automation systems.
To enable this you have to set `"enableControl": true,` platform level and optional the `port`.

**NOTE: It is currently not possible to query the current state**

The interface that the PLC operates consists only of the keyword 'control', the database number 'db', the address within the db 'offset' and the value 'value'.
The value is assigned to the matching ('db' and 'offset') set_* accessory configurations. For accessories with separate on/off configurations e.g. PLC_LightBulb set_On/set_Off the set_On has to be uses.  All information is transmitted within the URL and in decimal.

The Request has to be done as HTTP `PUT` or `GET` operation. There will be no logging when doing a `PUT` operation while there will be detailed output when during a `GET` operation. This in especially intended for testing with the browser as the browser performs a `GET` operation per default.

### Format
Example to switch a light bulb from browser. Lets say the light bulb has the following config:

	"platforms": [
			{
			"platform": "PLC",
			"ip": "10.10.10.32",
			"rack": 0,
			"slot": 2,
			"enableControl": true,
			"accessories": [
				{
						"accessory": "PLC_LightBulb",
						"name": "Light ",
						"db": 6096,
						"set_On": 1.1,
						"set_Off": 1.0,
						"get_On": 0.0
				}
			]
		}
	]

Use this to switch the light bulb on from browser:

	http://homebridgeIp:8080/?push&db=6096&offset=1.1&value=1

Use this to switch the light bulb off from browser:

	http://homebridgeIp:8080/?push&db=6096&offset=1.1&value=0

**NOTE:** Chrome/Edge does at minimum two requests with different parameters resulting in some error messages. I recommend `Talend API Tester - Free Edition`

# Test & Release

## Local test
The easiest is to open the terminal from homebridge delete the `index.js` file of this plugin, open nano and past in the new content.
Afterwards the Homebridge can be restarted.
The delete and open of hte index.js file can be done by the following command line.

`rm node_modules/homebridge-plc/index.js && nano node_modules/homebridge-plc/index.js`

## Publish npm package

`npm publish --access public`
