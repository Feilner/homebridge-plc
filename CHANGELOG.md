## [1.0.32] 2021-11-11

With the latest update of the Homebridge UI Docker container, the plugin does not start!

Error: The module ... node_snap7.node was compiled against a different Node.js version ... Please try re-compiling or re-installing ...

During installation of this module, snap7 is downloaded and compiled against the installed version of Node.js.
Therefore, the issue is fixed for sure by uninstalling and installing the homebridge_plc plugin.
