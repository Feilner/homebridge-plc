## [1.0.10] - 2020-10-26
### Added
- **Push support** from the PLC to the homebridge-plc plug in by a http request
- Poll support for all supported accessories. (Please inform me if one is not working as expected)

### Changed
- Accessory `PLC_WindowCovering`, `PLC_Window` and `PLC_Door` need to define new option `forceCurrentPosition` to maintain current behaviour! 

### Fixed
- Accessory `PLC_GarageDoorOpener` add missing `get_LockCurrentState` 

## [1.0.9] - 2020-10-21
### Added
- Accessory: `PLC_OccupancySensor`: Add polling to detect changes. New configuration `enablePolling` and `pollInterval`
- Accessory: `PLC_MotionSensor`: Add polling to detect changes. New configuration `enablePolling` and `pollInterval`
- Accessory: `PLC_ContactSensor` added.
- Accessory: `PLC_TemperatureSensor` Add option `minValue`, `maxValue` `minStep`
- Accessory: `PLC_HumiditySensor` Add option `minValue`, `maxValue` `minStep`
- Accessory: `PLC_LightBulb` Add option `minValue`, `maxValue` `minStep`

### Changed 
- `PLC_WindowCovering`, `PLC_Window` and `PLC_Door` got additionally to the `adaptivePolling` which polls the current state during movement a possibility to enable with `enablePolling` polling at with  lower frequency the current sate. Thus the option `pollInterval` changed its meaning it now defines the frequency for the `enablePolling` wile `adaptivePollingInterval` defines the frequency for the `adaptivePolling`.
